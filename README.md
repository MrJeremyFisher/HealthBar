A lightweight and highly configurable health display. This is effectively a rewrite
of [SilentChaos512's HealthBar](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/HealthBar), created for personal ease of updating to
newer minecraft versions. 

You can download the latest builds on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/healthbar2).
